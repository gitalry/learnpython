1) Syntax or format errors are a major problem for most beginning programmers using languages such as C++, Java, and C#.  A syntax error occurs when the programmer fails to obey one of the grammar rules of the language.  Typically this involves things like using the wrong case, putting punctuation where it is not supposed to be, failing to put punctuation where it is supposed to be, etc.


2) Run time errors are unhandled errors that are raised during runtime. For example, your code fails to get access to a remote machine. There is no way to be sure at compile time (when you compile your program) whether this error is SURELY going to happen or not. You can suspect that it happens though. 
ALTERNATIVELY
A runtime error occurs whenever the program instructs the computer to do something that it is either incapable or unwilling to do.  Since there are a near infinite number of things that fall in this category, there are a near infinite number of ways to write programs that cause runtime errors.
The classical way to demonstrate a runtime error is to instruct the computer to divide any number by the value zero.  Any value divided by 0 produces an infinitely large result, which is too large to be accommodated by the computer.  Therefore, in most cases, the computer will tell you that it is unable to perform that operation.




3) Logic Errors :The syntax is correct. No runtime error is being raised, however your program logic is not correct (for example an incorrect formula). 
ALTERNATIVELY
Logic errors are usually the most difficult kind of errors to find and fix, because there frequently is no obvious indication of the error.  Usually the program runs successfully.  It simply doesn't behave as it should.  In other words, it simply doesn't produce the correct answers.
